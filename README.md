# WIP: Astwoah Stack

An opinionated stack that is the simplest and funnest web development experience. (Very similar to the [AHA stack](https://ahastack.dev/).)

## Stack

### UI Layer

- [Astro](https://astro.build/) - A simple web metaframework.
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) - For styling.
- [Daisy UI](https://daisyui.com/) - For a Bootstrap-like UI CSS component library, built upon Tailwind.

### Interactivity Layer

- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) - For type safety.
- [AlpineJS](https://alpinejs.dev/) - For state management and interactivity.
- [HTMX](https://htmx.org/) - For sending HTML partials/snippets over the wire.

### Backend Data Layer

TBD. Considering [Pocketbase](https://pocketbase.io/), [Supabase](https://supabase.com/), [Appwrite](https://appwrite.io/), and [Baserow](https://baserow.io/).io. Or, even a local-first approach like IndexedDB.

## Vision

I dream of a lightweight, simple web development stack that invokes a fun web experience.

### Core Principles

- Fast — Use an HTML-first approach, where almost all of the work is done on the DOM layer: styling, structuring, and interactivity.
- Fun — Remove barriers of traditional JavaScript frameworks, such as excessive boilerplate code or intense state management.
- Simple — Go back to the basics of web development. (_While this is not vanilla, the dev experience will feel very natural._)

### Contributions

I'll consider a contribution, but please [open an issue](https://github.com/astwoah/astwoah-stack/issues) if you'd like to contribute.
