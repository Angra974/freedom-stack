# WIP: Astwoah Stack

An opinionated stack that is the simplest and funnest web development experience. (Very similar to the [AHA stack](https://ahastack.dev/).)

## Stack

### UI Layer

- [Astro](https://astro.build/) - A simple web metaframework.
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) - For styling.
- [Daisy UI](https://daisyui.com/) - For a Bootstrap-like UI CSS component library, built upon Tailwind.

### Interactivity Layer

- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) - For type safety.
- [AlpineJS](https://alpinejs.dev/) - For state management and interactivity.
- [HTMX](https://htmx.org/) - For sending HTML partials/snippets over the wire.

### Backend Data Layer

TBD. Considering [Pocketbase](https://pocketbase.io/), [Supabase](https://supabase.com/), [Appwrite](https://appwrite.io/), and [Baserow](https://baserow.io/).io. Or, even a local-first approach like IndexedDB.

## Vision

I dream of a lightweight, simple web development stack that invokes a fun web experience at the cheapest possible maintainance, backend, and server cost. As close to free as possible.

### Core Principles

- **Approachable** — I want those new to web development to feel comfortable using this stack. Things like database management should feel intuitive. Remove barriers of traditional JavaScript frameworks, such as excessive boilerplate code or intense state management. Go back to the basics of web development. (_While this is not vanilla, the dev experience will feel very natural._)
- **Flow-able** — Use an HTML-first approach, where almost all of the work is done on the DOM layer: styling, structuring, and interactivity. A simple focus helps you get in the flow of code faster. Fast setup. Fast building. Fast shipping.
- **Pocket-friendly** — Using this stack will be financially maintainable to anyone, especially indie hackers and those creating startup sites / web apps. Any 3rd party integrations or backend as a service tooling chosen will have a generous free tier.

### Contributions

I'll consider a contribution, but please [open an issue](https://github.com/cameronapak/astwoah-stack/issues) if you'd like to contribute.
