  "letter_content_markdown": "I dream of a lightweight, simple web development stack that invokes a fun web experience at the cheapest possible maintenance, backend, and server cost. As close to free as possible. I wanted to provide a stack that's powerful like Ruby on Rails _(\"The One Person Framework\")_, but with the ease and \"vanilla\" web dev feel of Astro. Freedom Stack is built on three core principles:\n\n- **Approachable** — Making web development feel natural and comfortable, especially for newcomers\n- **Flow-able** — Using an HTML-first approach that helps you focus and get in the zone faster\n- **Pocket-friendly** — Keeping it financially maintainable for everyone, from indie hackers to startups\n\nThis is only the beginning. It's a joy to work on this project and to give it freely. Long story short, I was bed-ridden sick for about 7 months, not knowing if I'd make it out. [God](https://www.gotquestions.org/what-is-the-gospel.html) took care of me through friends and family. He healed me on the inside before he healed me on the outside. Ever since, I've had a deep desire to create digital experiences that lead to freedom. May Freedom Stack be a blessing to you to create whatever dreams and visions on your heart and mind.\n\nFreedom Stack:\n\n- Feels vanilla, with the power of modern frameworks. No need for Docker. Just throw it on Netlify and you're good to go.\n- Is built with Astro, Alpine.js, HTMX, Astro DB, Clerk Auth, Preline UI, daisyUI, & Lucide Icons. Enjoy building apps.\n- Has a low barrier to entry, making it easy to learn and start building fast. Get in the zone and stay in it.\n\n_— [Cam Pak](https://cameronpak.com)_"
